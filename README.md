## Update Pangolin.json

R and Python scripts to update pangolin.json lineage entries


### Running the Scripts

Both the R and Python scripts take as input a json file and a CSV file. The json (pangolin.json) has the incomplete or not update entries that need to be modified. The CSV file should have the name of the sequence and the lineage to be assigned.
